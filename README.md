## Functions
1. move_player: The most basic function of this game will be the function of moving a character around the 2D space using the arrow keys. This will allow the player to move up, down, left, right, and diagnal. So far I have drawn a rectangle to represent the player and connected the keyboard inputs of A, S, D, and E to correspond with the rectangle moving in different directions.  
2. spawn_mobs(level: int) -> list: This function generates enemy mobs based on the current planetâ€™s difficulty level, increasing their number and abilities as the player progresses. Each mob type has unique movement patterns and behaviors that keep the game feeling fresh.
3. use_powerup(powerup_name: str) -> None: This function will allow for a string of powerups to be spawned in at random to the maze. Each power up give the player different advantages during different stages of gameplay.
